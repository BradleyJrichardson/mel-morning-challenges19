## Part 1

You're working for a client.

They want a ‘sign up’ page that has a form collecting the following information: name, email, DOB, gender (with a radio button), state (from a drop down menu - so look up the select element), a checkbox that says they are happy for you to send them emails about special deals and a submit button.

## Part 2

Make the form centred in the middle of the page.

Add a H1 and a navbar above the form.

Change the size of the text form inputs (width and height).

Set a limit for characters in the name and email inputs (only 100 characters allowed).
